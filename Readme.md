# Rainfall

## Overview
Rainfall is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge focused primarily on reverse engineering and exploiting known vulnerabilities. Participants will engage in a series of tasks that require crafting payloads to exploit these vulnerabilities and gain access.

## Features
-   Reverse engineering challenges.
-   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
-   Payload crafting to gain access and solve challenges.
-   Detailed solutions provided for each level, explaining the concepts and methods used.
-   Some tutos and usefull tools in UsefullLink file

## Prerequisites
-   A Unix-like operating system.
-   Basic knowledge of reverse engineering tools and techniques.
-   Familiarity with common vulnerabilities and exploitation methods.

##  Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/jbettini/Rainfall.git
cd Rainfall
```
## Usage

Each challenge is designed to be solved sequentially. Follow the instructions provided in each challenge directory to exploit the vulnerabilities and progress through the CTF.
